For this modpack to install correctly, you will need to follow the instructions below:

1) Download this repo as a ".zip" by pressing the "ZIP" button above.

2) Now you will need to extract the Electricraft.zip that you download to anywhere that you want.
Tt doesn't really matter.

3) The next step is to run the "Install.bat" file that came with the download. This will install the modpack for you.

4) All you really need to do now, is to download the "Magic Launcher" from: "http://magiclauncher.com/adload.php?f=MagicLauncher_1.0.0.exe".
After you have downloaded and saved the ".exe", you will need to enter your Username and Password but dont login yet. After you have entered your credentials,
press the setup button. You will see a lot of confusing buttons, but we dont even need to touch most of them. Firstly press the "New" button. For the "Configuration"
field, type "Electricraft" or something similar. (Its just a name, so it doesn't matter.) In the copy from dropdown menu, select "-". Press "Ok" and your config is setup.
Now, onto the minecraft.jar, press the select button next to the minecraft.jar selection menu. The path for the select should be: "C:\Users\*YOUR USERNAME HERE*\AppData\Roaming\.electricraft\.minecraft\bin\minecraft.jar"
You should see a box lower down the page called "External Mods", make sure that that box is checked.
Now, go to the advanced tab and you should see a "Base folder" selection window (it sorta looks like the minecraft.jar one).
Check the box named "Custom" and press the select button.
Again, the path should be: "C:\Users\*YOUR USERNAME HERE*\AppData\Roaming\.electricraft\.minecraft".
Press "Ok" at the bottom and select the config you just created above your Username. You should now be ready to login!
The IP for the server is: "unitedgamers121.no-ip.org:2565"

5) Have Fun!
